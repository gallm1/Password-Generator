# 03 - Password-Generator Homework
## Description
This project is for homework assignment #3, creating a random password generator.

What was able to create successfully:
    -- a prompt pointed to the Generate Password button, which asks for character length of 8 to 128
    -- created an alert if they character length does not meet criteria
    -- if met criteria, created a confirm option for lower case (Y/N)
    -- then confirms upper case (Y/N)
    -- then confirms number (Y/N)
    -- then confirms special character (Y/N)
    -- was able to create individual random functions for each character type above

What I wasn't able to finish:
    -- connecting the variables/prompts/confirms to the random functions to generate an output/password
    
A Git hub repository has been created and cloned to my desktop.  Once the homework is finalized, I will push the repository back to Git hub, copy the link to the repository and the website and submit my homework.
